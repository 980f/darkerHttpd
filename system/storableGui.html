    <p>how to edit Storables via html</p>
    <p>When building a screen attached a change watcher to each Storable for which a display or input field is generated.<br>
      That change watcher will queue up the Storable's path on a list that is sigc::binded to it and that is a member of the htmlserver.</p>
    <p>The web page will have script for bringing up the appropriate editor type for each input field (onclick member of the tag). The editor is given the storable path
      and triggers a POST as well as locally updating the DOM.<br>
      <br>
      The http server receives the POST with the path of the edited object and its new value and chases down the field from our root of roots (variable name Yggdrasil?
      MOAR: Mother Of All Roots?) and sets it. If necessary the search root could be a hidden input field. Upon the return from the Storable.setFrom(Text) the change
      watchers have built a list of fields to send back and the HTTP return document is a set of key:value pairs built by scanning that list.</p>
    <p>The client receiving the response to the POST updates the DOM, finding the html entity whose id attribute matches the path expressed in the key.</p>
    <p>To support remote logic generating the web ui we will need queries for fields which only exist conditionally, such as analytes and regions (always will be
      members of a StoredGroup, but a generic editor like we use in the service screens is also supportable). <br>
      <br>
      A semi-reflective gui generator can be built via having a GuiGenerator member on each Storable, defaulting to one picked by the node type. This is
      complicated&nbsp; by marketing requests for a gui that has Storables which are not siblings or which leave out siblings. That can be handled by creating a tree of
      Storables just for gui generation. Such nodes would be from a StoredGroup&lt;StoredLabel&gt; where the values are StorablePaths and whose GuiGenerator contains
      the layout rules. IE, our static layout screens would be objects injected into the Storable tree and invoked from there. </p>
    <p>Buttons that trigger a screen change do so by sending a value to an object whose gui related change watcher puts a Storable-which-is-a-screen-definition into the
      reply list. The POST reply would be prefaced with 'replace dom' instead of 'update dom'.</p>
    <p>To support remote (custom) gui generation we need to be able to return information about a StoredGroup's nodes. We could support a GET which gets the types of
      the Storable's starting at a StorablePath, and the guigenerator object has a getType member supplying that info. This would be a nested JSON object whereas screen
      updates are likely to be flattened (depends upon how the script can find DOM nodes, a tree might actually work nicely).</p>
