you will need to install development packages for:

libudev

sudo apt-get install libudev-dev

libftdi source has been copied into this file tree, some debug edits have been made to it but no logic has been changed.
I would have done the same with libudev but couldn't find a definitive origin for its source. Switching to eudev might fix that.

Especially noteworthy is that errno is made available at critical junctures where it had been getting dropped, which was making understanding the nature of an I/O error hard to chase down.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
the libusb subfolder is copied from the libusb source git via a procedure similar to that which follows for libftdi1.
We leave out the os/ bits for non-linux os, if you are using a bsd you will have to include those.

We did this so that we could single step and add debug messages in the bowels of the package, simpler than trying to have gdb find a debug package that matches the source.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Many of the files in the usb repo are the core part of the open source libftdi project.
To import updates of libftdi1:

Somewhere convenient:
git clone git://developer.intra2net.com/libftdi
cd libftdi

git checkout <the appropriate tag>

mkdir build
cd build
cmake ../

-- Do not run make or make install, cmake creates the .h file from .h.in files else one could just copy them over.
-- It may be that the .h files in the repo are already proper for this project, but til then do the above.

Copy just the following source files to the usb repo:
ftdi.c
ftdi.h
ftdi_i.h
ftdi_version_i.h

Do a git commit with a comment as to what the libftdi tag was.


ftdlib.cpp and h (and the other files) in usb are 980f/andy-h's own source. It is a minimalist equivalent of the ftdipp part of libftdi, but with very few actual lines of unmodified code therefrom.
